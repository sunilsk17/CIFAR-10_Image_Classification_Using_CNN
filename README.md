# Image Classification using CNN with CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes include Airplanes, Cars, Birds, Cats, Deer, Dogs, Frogs, Horses, Ships, and Trucks.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of CNNs in image classification tasks, particularly with the CIFAR-10 dataset. The low-resolution (32x32) images present a challenging yet common scenario in computer vision.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is provided by the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research (CIFAR). You can find more information and download the dataset [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
